Featuring a bright and bold yellow base that’s artfully interspersed with wavy grey lines and a pop of red branding, it gives off a look that’s unmistakably Kanye West: loud and impossible to ignore. It’s also the first Yeezy 350 to feature a gun sole, an old-school detail that provides a stark and interesting contrast with the loud upper. Originally releasing in November of 2017, the “Semi Frozen Yellow” adidas Yeezys first hit the market in extremely limited quantities, but for their second go-around, they’ll be available at significantly more retailers than the original drop.',

        title: 'The Nike Air Fear Of God Shoot Around Releases This Weekend',
        text: 'This weekend, Jerry Lorenzo‘s first official foray with the Swoosh Brand will begin with the introduction of his Air Fear Of God collection. Highlighted by the debut of his Air Fear Of God 1 silhouette in attractive black and white color schemes, it appears that Lorenzo and Nike will also be dropping the Air Fear Of God Shoot Around sneaker. Serving as a “takedown” model of sorts, this lifestyle version of the Air Fear Of God line comes devoid of any midfoot cages and boasts a more seamless upper composed of a one-piece construction and a clasp-style lacing system. With double the Zoom Air cushioning in its heels, the Shoot Around is a street-ready statement piece that has the comfort to be worn in nearly any situation. Equipping the same design language as the other two FOG x Nike collaborative creations that heavily draw from the crossover space shared between basketball and the streets, the Shoot Around is more specifically designed to be worn before the game begins, so do not expect to see PJ Tucker hooping in these any time soon. While this model is not as souped up – if you will – as the Fear Of God 1s, its premium materials, and luxe aesthetic have still lent to a rather lofty $300 USD price tag. Grab a first look at the new Nike Air Fear Of God Shoot Around below and stay tuned for more information regarding its December 15th drop as we have it. While you wait, be sure to check out our Fear Of God buying guide in the meantime.',

        text: 'From sneakers to ice cream, from shirts to cereal, Kith can seemingly do it all. The New York-based brand/retailer has a long collaborative history with New Balance spanning an even dozen collaborative releases, and now they’ve readied a fresh six-shoe collection for 2018. Each of the half-dozen shoes draws its inspiration from two of founder Ronnie Fieg‘s favorite New Balances of all time: the United Arrows & Sons 997.5 and nonnative 997.5, and were created in collaboration with both parties to ensure maximum authenticity. While one silhouette in the collection is a classic 997, the other two offer a new look: the 997S is a modernized version of the classic New Balance 997, while the 997S Fusion takes a OG upper and melds it with a brand-new sole for a fusion-style look. One colorway of each silhouette nods to United Arrows & Sons, while the other acknowledges nonnative. The former calls upon dark blacks and greys with bright pink/purple accents, while the latter opts for a more earthy look with brown/black tones and bright cobalt blue accents. Fieg’s well-known attention to detail is present as well, with each midfoot “N” logo featuring a triple-stacked design — a clever nod to the three parties involved in each collaboration. The collection is awash in premium materials as well, with United Arrows using soft pigskin suede and rich buttery leather, while nonnative calls upon exotic textiles the likes of pony hair and ostrich-embossed leather. The collection is set to release November 21st at Kith stores and their webstore, so get a look at all six kicks below, and let us know which pair from the collection is your favorite in the comments.',
